## Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
### Project Description
Social networks are a fascinating domains for applying concepts from data science and visualization. Not only are they sources of **big** "big data" (about 500 million tweets are sent on Twitter each _day_), but their status as personal communities means that they often can provide profound insights into how people think, feel, and interact. For example, researchers have shown that the "mood" of Twitter communication [reflects biological rhythms](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/science/30twitter.html) and can even be used to [predict the stock market](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.3003&embedded=true).

For this assignment, I wrote a program to perform simple [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) of Twitter data---that is, determining the "attitude" of tweets (how "positive" or "negative") about a particular topic. You will apply this program to **real data** taken directly from Twitter, and use your analysis to consider basic questions about people's attitudes on social media.

### Objectives
By completing this challenge you will practice and master the following skills:

* Working with Python data structures: lists, dictionaries, and tuples
* Using Python loops and conditionals
* Defining re-usable functions that take in parameters and return data
* Programmatically processing, filtering, and organizing textual data
* Accessing a public data API
* Analyzing, interpreting, and visualizing data with __SciPy, Pandas, Bokeh, Matplotlib__.

### Instructions
1. Clone this repository. 
2. Download Twitter Data using __"twitter_stream.py"__ file in the terminal. Rember to input your own token.
3. Save the data printed in the terminal to .txt files, and put it in the __"data"__ folder. Notice the original 3 .txt files are there for illustration purpose.
4. Use Jupyter Notebook to open the __"Tweet_Sentiments_Analysis.ipynb"__. I have provided several data analysis and visualization strategies for your reference. 
5. Feel free to explore on your own researches and enjoy.
6. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any suggestions.
